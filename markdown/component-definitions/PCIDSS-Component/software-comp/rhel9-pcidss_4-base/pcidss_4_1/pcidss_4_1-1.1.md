# pcidss_4_1-1.1 - \[REPLACE_ME\] All Security Policies And Operational Procedures That Are Identified In Requirement 1 Are Documented, Kept Up To Date, In Use And Known To All Affected Parties.

## Control Statement

______________________________________________________________________

## What is the solution and how is it implemented?

<!-- For implementation status enter one of: implemented, partial, planned, alternative, not-applicable -->

<!-- Note that the list of rules under ### Rules: is read-only and changes will not be captured after assembly to JSON -->

Examine documentation and interview personnel to verify that security policies and                operational procedures identified in Requirement 1 are managed in accordance with all                elements specified in this requirement.

### Purpose
Requirement 4.1.1 is about effectively managing and maintaining the various policies and
procedures specified throughout Requirement 4. While it is important to define the specific policies
or procedures called out in Requirement 4, it is equally important to ensure they are properly
documented, maintained, and disseminated. 

### Good Practice
It is important to update policies and procedures as needed to address changes in processes,
technologies, and business objectives. For this reason, consider updating these documents as
soon as possible after a change occurs and not only on a periodic cycle.

### Definitions
Security policies define the entity’s security objectives and principles. Operational procedures
describe how to perform activities, and define the controls, methods, and processes that are
followed to achieve the desired result in a consistent manner and in accordance with policy
objectives. Policies and procedures, including updates, are actively communicated to all affected
personnel, and are supported by operating procedures describing how to perform activities.
